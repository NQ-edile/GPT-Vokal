Chrome extension that allows you to tell ChatGPT what you want it to do instead of typing. 

Extension is not live, here's how you can use it:

0. Clone the repo

1. Open Google Chrome 
    -> Go to the hamburger menu 
        -> More Tools 
            -> Extensions 
                -> (top left) Choose Load Unpacked 
                    -> Choose the repo folder

2. Open ChatGPT, you'll probably be asked for Mic and Camera permissions. Allow that.
    -> You'll see an indication that that tab is linstening

3. Use phrase "MAX" before every query you make:
    e.g. "Max Who is the president of South Africa"

4. The SpeechRecognition will take everything that comes after "MAX" as a ChatGPT query.
    -> Meaning that the query will be -> "Who is the president of South Africa"

5. KINDA SUCKS THAT IT WILL ALWAYS BE LISTENING, COULDN'T ADD A BUTTON: BUT NOTHING HAPPENS UNTIL IT PICKS ON THE PHRASE MAX!
